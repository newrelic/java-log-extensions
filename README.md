# New Relic logging extensions

The New Relic logging plugins are extensions for common Java logging frameworks. They are designed to capture app,
transaction trace, and span information as part of your application log messages.

For the latest information, please see the [New Relic Documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/new-relic-logs/enable-logs-context/enable-logs-context-java).

We support:

* [java.util.logging](jul/README.md)
* [Apache Log4j 2.13.2 or higher](log4j2/README.md)
  * We strongly suggest that log4j 2.15.x or higher be used to avoid [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)
* [Apache Log4j 1.x](log4j1/README.md)
* [Logback 1.3](logback13/README.md)
* [Logback 1.2](logback/README.md)
* [Logback 1.1](logback11/README.md)
* [Dropwizard 1.3](dropwizard/README.md)

## Configuration Options
The following config options apply to all supported logging frameworks, with some noted exceptions.

### Mapped Diagnostic Context (MDC)
Not all logging frameworks provide an MDC mechanism (e.g. JUL) but for those that do you can configure
the logging extension to add the MDC data in addition to the trace context data from New Relic.

Default for adding MDC is `false`, change this to `true` if you wish to include MDC data on log events. It can be configured by
environment variable (`NEW_RELIC_LOG_EXTENSION_ADD_MDC=boolean`) or system property (`-Dnewrelic.log_extension.add_mdc=boolean`).

Note that, if set to `true` all MDC data will be added to log events. Currently, there is no filtering capability for excluding specific MDC entries.

MDC data will be added to log events with a `context.` prefix to distinguish it as user defined context data as well as to prevent potential
collisions with New Relic specific context keys.

### Exception Stack Trace Size
**Note:** The log extensions now have the ability to capture the entire stack trace - specifically any `caused by` sections.
Prior versions of the extension only reported the trace for the thrown exception and ignored any nested `caused by` `Throwables`.

You can configure the logging extension to control the max stack trace size for exceptions added to log events.

Default max stack trace size is `300`. It is recommended that you do not exceed this value or data could be dropped or truncated as well as
lead to higher log event ingest costs. Max stack trace size can be configured by environment variable (`NEW_RELIC_LOG_EXTENSION_MAX_STACK_SIZE=integer`)
or system property (`-Dnewrelic.log_extension.max_stack_size=integer`).

Explicitly setting this property to `0` will not impose a maximum size constraint on the stack trace size.
